There is a motion FIFO for the robot with move and rotate commands in the polar case. 

If you ask the robot to move forward 10 inches it will do so .1 inch at a time and fire move on itself for the sensors to poll.
    
A free running interval timer has ticks at a frequency governed by the speed setting for the robot.

Ticks cause motion commands to be pulled from the fifo and executed.
