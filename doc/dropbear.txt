PROBLEM : SSH not working on 192.168.7.2 but can ping it. SSH working on 192.168.1.125.

  - Dropbear seems to have these services associated with it in /lib/systemd/system
    - lrwxrwxrwx  1 root  root      9 Feb 10 17:49 dropbear.service -> /dev/null
    -rw-r--r--  1 root  root    131 Jul  3  2013 dropbear.socket
    -rw-r--r--  1 root  root    276 Jul  3  2013 dropbear@.service
    -rw-r--r--  1 root  root    243 Jul  3  2013 dropbearkey.service
    
  - systemctl status dropbearkey.service => inactive
    - this is correct as it is only started if there is no file /etc/dropbear/dropbear_rsa_host_key
  - systemctl status dropbear.socket => active ok
  - Also the following services appear
  
  dropbear@0-192.168.7.2:22-192.168.7.1:49176.service         loaded active running   SSH Per-Connection Server
  dropbear@1-192.168.1.125:22-192.168.1.82:49177.service      loaded active running   SSH Per-Connection Server
  dropbear@2-192.168.7.2:22-192.168.7.1:49178.service         loaded active running   SSH Per-Connection Server
  dropbear@3-192.168.7.2:22-192.168.7.1:49428.service         loaded active running   SSH Per-Connection Server
  dropbear@4-192.168.7.2:22-192.168.7.1:49728.service         loaded active running   SSH Per-Connection Server
  
  
TRY: restart beagle with just ethernet plugged in. See what dropbear services appear when sshing into 125.
RESULT: I just get the one service:
dropbear@0-192.168.1.125:22-192.168.1.82:49777.service      loaded active running   SSH Per-Connection Server

TRY: SSHing again on 125 from a different terminal: 
I get one service for each connection:
dropbear@0-192.168.1.125:22-192.168.1.82:49777.service      loaded active running   SSH Per-Connection Server
dropbear@1-192.168.1.125:22-192.168.1.82:49778.service      loaded active running   SSH Per-Connection Server


TRY: Plug in the usb. 
ifconfig: shows usb0 up.
systemctl shows same 2 as above
Now try to ssh 192.168.7.2
Now I get:
dropbear@0-192.168.1.125:22-192.168.1.82:49777.service      loaded active running   SSH Per-Connection Server
dropbear@1-192.168.1.125:22-192.168.1.82:49778.service      loaded active running   SSH Per-Connection Server
dropbear@2-192.168.7.2:22-192.168.7.1:49789.service         loaded active running   SSH Per-Connection Server

CONCLUSION: It appears that the ssh server on the beagle is starting up properly
and I have 3 dropbears running:
root       442     1  0 20:43 ?        00:00:01 /usr/sbin/dropbear -i -r /etc/dropbear/dropbear_rsa_host_key -p 22
root       518     1  0 20:45 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/dropbear -i -r /etc/dropbear/dropbear_rsa_host_key -p 22
root       526     1  0 20:48 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/dropbear -i -r /etc/dropbear/dropbear_rsa_host_key -p 22


QUESTION where is it failing?

CONCLUSION: The pc isnt receiving anything from the beagle when it connects on socket  with port 22.

TRY: What do the syslog files on the beagle.
  - dmesg => [ 3368.254800] systemd[1]: avahi-daemon.service start request repeated too quickly, refusing to start.
  - journalctl =>

TRY: Remove the big directories I added when doing opencv stuff. and reboot.

IT WORKS!!!!
