Architecture
------------

  - Browser on pc calls node api to snap and calculate
  - Node server on bb calls python
  - Python returns the calculation and filename for the image
  - Node server calls back browser with calculation and image
  - Browser redirects robot and shows image.

  - Get opencv with python on angstrom:
  - opkg install python-opencv
  

TRY: 
  import cv2
  import numpy as np
  cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
  
PROBLEM: I get:
  VIDIOC_QUERYMENU: Invalid argument
  VIDIOC_QUERYMENU: Invalid argument
  VIDIOC_QUERYMENU: Invalid argument
  VIDIOC_QUERYMENU: Invalid argument
  VIDIOC_QUERYMENU: Invalid argument
  VIDIOC_QUERYMENU: Invalid argument
  VIDIOC_QUERYMENU: Invalid argument
  
  ret, frame = cap.read()
  select timeout
  gives ret=true, but a black frame.

TRY: Following derek molloys video on connecting video
  - git his code
  - compiled
  - capture which tries to capture video fails => select timeout
  - but grabber works.
  
TRY: Figure out what grabber is doing and see if there is a command in python to do the same.

People having the same problem...

TRY: Just use grabber.
  - TEST - Which of the cameras does it work with?
    - Camera A - Yes
    - Camera B - Yes
    - Camera C - Yes
  160
  - Capture only 1 image at 640x480
  
PROBLEM
  - Camera A when I try to set the frame size using v4l2 I get random results
TRY camera b and c
  - Camera b - More problems:
    - Seems to ignore or do random things with settings of width and height.
    - When I was able to capture an image it was not recognizable by convert
    - Hangs waiting for the camera to fill the iobuffer.
    
TRY: Lets debug with camera A:
  - grab 2 stills with the following frame sizes:  
640x480 => Hangs on clearing buffer
160x120 => Works
176x144 => Works
320x176 => Works
320x240 => Works
432x240 => Works
352x288 => Works
544x288 => Works

TODO:
 - Create a py file that captures a couple frames prints out a result.
